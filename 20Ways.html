                                                            classroom. GEMS promotes self study and the consolidation of
                                                            topics before moving on, developing an inner desire to

                                        <p>Away from traditional assessments which invariably compare children, CIS
                                            highlights progress, marks gained against one’s
                                            own personal baseline, documented objectively at the beginning and end of
                                            each term. This inspires all children to excel
                                            in their studies. The "Dynamic" assessment reports build an intrinsic desire
                                            to excel and create the feeling “I can”
                                            instead of “I can’t”. CIS believes it important to preserve a child’s sense
                                            of his / her inner greatness and to
                                            continually nurture confidence through self-knowledge and clearly defined
                                            parameters for success that make each child a

                                            students of a class make a paper cut out, for example, a flower cut out with
                                            the number of petals equal to the
                                            number of Perbooks they need to complete in a term. All these are pinned to
                                            a soft board in the class.</p>

                                        <p>The students fill out each petal as they complete each Perbook (once accepted
                                            by the teacher as complete). The short
                                            term goal is to complete one Perbook per week and the long term goal is to
                                            complete all Perbooks allocated for the term.
                                            The students can always add to the allocated set of Perbooks by adding more
                                            petals.</p>

                                        <p>Look, for example, that Pupil 2 on the right has completed 8 out of his 9
                                            Perbools for the term in just one month! He
                                            can continue to do Perbooks at higher levels beyond those completed. Pupil 1
                                            has completed according to the given goals
                                            but Pupil 3 is falling behind goals for which some remedial action is
                                            required.</p>

                                            children most enjoy their hands-on mathematics assessment experience. The
                                            class is divided into two parts and each child
                                            is given two different hands-on assessments to do.</p>
                                        <p>Doing it the hands-on way consolidates learning and the children are able to
                                            relate hands-on experiences to mathematical
                                            concepts, facts and formulae.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, children learn through their senses.

                                        <p>Show and Tell is done throughout our primary classes. Children bring things
                                            from home or create props to speak about.
                                            The goal is extempore speaking with confidence. Every child gets the same
                                            opportunity and the whole class participates
                                            in evaluating. This helps develop critical thinking skills at the same time
                                            as they learn to focus on proper
                                            pronunciation, voice intonation for emphasis, the value of good beginning

                                            the use of props, quotations and poetry, research on a topic, etc. The
                                            children are also appreciated for their ‘Show and

                                        <p>New approaches are used to develop the skill to compose well. After research,
                                            the children are able to compose and
                                            articulate their understanding much better than when simply asked to write a
                                            few lines without preparation or with
                                            keywords alone. Instead, we ask a number of natural questions around a
                                            topic, shown here for example, on the topic
                                            ‘Birds’.</p>

                                        <p>By posing questions (as shown from a MAXIM page above) and researching these
                                            questions either in a library or on-line,
                                            children develop a far better understanding of birds. They also learn new
                                            vocabulary and develop curiosity. Children are
                                            asked to pose their own questions as well and find answers. They can thus
                                            structure their thoughts much better after
                                            this process and write a far better composition.</p>

                                        <p>If our objective is to build the capacity to better express in English, these
                                            methods are very useful. In addition, the
                                            process develops critical thinking skills including skills to research on a
                                            new topic, use imagination, ask good
                                            questions, etc.</p>

                                            range of pedagogical learning materials are
                                            arranged on low level shelves for children to pick up and work on their own.
                                            Children work independently, in groups and
                                            as a class. Circle time involves singing songs, playing percussion
                                            instruments, acknowledging each other, talking about
                                            things on their minds, show and tell, walking in a circle and balancing
                                            objects. Learning environments and field trips
                                            address their senses and their multiple intelligences. Many music and art
                                            forms are explored together to nurture
                                            creativity, develop curiosity, stimulate their senses and inspire their
                                            little souls.</p>

                                        <p>This has become another avenue for creating active classrooms!</p>

                                        <p>There is a process and a method to peer teaching/ learning and to peer and
                                            self assessments by which teachers can be
                                            most effective. We have observed many creative ways in which our teachers
                                            have begun to engage students, from instant on
                                            the spot checks done verbally, to children coming to up to the blackboard
                                            and detailing each step which other children
                                            review their copies against.</p>

                                        <p>Worldwide research has shown that instant feedback is more effective than
                                            when a teacher brings back the corrected work
                                            a day or more later. By this time, the children have moved on to other
                                            lessons and they rarely get the full advantage of
                                            their teachers’ hard work put into the traditional correction process.</p>

                                        <p>Peer and Self Corrections, on the other hand, provide not only instant
                                            feedback and reinforce learning, they are
                                            powerful ways to develop both self-confidence and critical thinking skills.
                                            These help solidify learning by providing a
                                            second chance to review completed work. By correcting each others’ work the
                                            students learn in addition to take
                                            responsibility and develop leadership skills.</p>

                                        <p>By correcting their own work, students learn critical self-evaluation skills
                                            – this being the highest form of learning
                                            in the Bloom Taxonomy.</p>

                                        <p>Self-checks allow children to view their exercises over time as puzzles. In
                                            due course, children learn to love
                                            correcting their own work, safe in the knowledge that they will not be
                                            judged by the outcome – by their parents,
                                            teachers or peers.</p>

                                            and its presentations. This work is
                                            undertaken in mixed age settings whereby older children learn to lead and
                                            the younger children aspire to do more and
                                            look up to the older ones.</p>

                                        <p>Through thematic work, team work skills are also developed, so that

                                            and presentation skills are nurtured. Children write their own music,
                                            affirmations and raps. They learn to sew and knit
                                            and they learn to do action service.</p>

                                        <p>All CIS events have some social objective. For example, ‘SCREAM Against Child
                                            Labour’ was organised by the school
                                            children.</p>

                                        <p>CIS nurtures every child’s desire to serve and make a meaningful
                                            contribution. Age appropriate activities are planned
                                            that deepen emotion and inspire the human spirit to serve, act consciously
                                            and become leaders of thought and action.
                                            Service is not only an act of charity. CIS focuses on service as a way of
                                            life.</p>
